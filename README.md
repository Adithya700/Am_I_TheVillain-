### Project Description
A brutally honest web app that tells you whether you‚Äôre the innocent victim, a mildly problematic side character, or the full-blown villain of your own story. No sugar-coating, just AI-powered judgment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs world, we have no reliable way to confirm if we‚Äôre actually the bad guy ‚Äî except for self-reflection, therapy, or talking to friends (boring).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An AI that reads your side of the story and serves judgment with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It detects sass, drama, and suspicious behavior, then declares your villain status with absolute (over)confidence.

You start by typing your story or situation into the input box.Think of it like telling your side of the drama‚Äîwhat happened, how you acted, all the juicy details.You can choose for the evil mood which basically encourage you on all your mistakes and a smart mood which tells you in real if u were right way or not.
Once you hit the analyze button, the AI reads your story carefully, looking for clues about your behavior.The AI then decides if you‚Äôre innocent,roblematic or On a Full-on Villain Arc (yikes, watch out!).The app shows you the verdict on the screen, usually with some fun text or emoji vibes.
You can try multiple stories, tweak what you say, and see how the AI‚Äôs opinion changes.It‚Äôs like having a brutally honest friend who doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat your actions.
