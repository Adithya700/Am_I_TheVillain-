# Am I The Villian üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Brain not found


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Devu Sunish - Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science

### Project Description
A brutally honest web app that tells you whether you‚Äôre the innocent victim, a mildly problematic side character, or the full-blown villain of your own story. No sugar-coating, just AI-powered judgment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today‚Äôs world, we have no reliable way to confirm if we‚Äôre actually the bad guy ‚Äî except for self-reflection, therapy, or talking to friends (boring).

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An AI that reads your side of the story and serves judgment with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It detects sass, drama, and suspicious behavior, then declares your villain status with absolute (over)confidence.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
